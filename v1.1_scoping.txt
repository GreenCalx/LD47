Must do:
	Bugs:
		- break, manque precedentes inputs
		- tick en trop à la fin
		- breaking during rewind should be impossible
		- switches should reset too and rewinding
	Features:
		- replay backward ticks
		- changer touches
		- input during replay to break => record
	UI:
		- highlight current turn
		- schnibble splash screen
		x when you break all previous inputs are still displayed (no dead black turns override)
	Graphics:
		- find solution to highlight player from last loop from other loop
	Audio:
		- remove failed rewind effect
	Level design:
		- tuto level
		- better difficulty curve overall
		- make level selector a "world" level (inspiration baba is you)

Nice to have:
	- fast forward
	- gamepad
	- find better audio/graphics effects during replay/rewind vs recording
	- menu (quit, audio settings, return, level selector)
	- story/lore

v1.x:
	- système de sauvegardes (surtout pas ODT)
	- cinematic
	- optional lore ingame
	- graphics experiments
	- map editor
	- more intersting tiles
	- more worlds
	- think for Smartphones
	- Steam
