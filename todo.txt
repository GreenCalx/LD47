- one less segment? looks like 6 segments right now
- maxEnergy should decrease by one for each loop break
- no time ticking (at least for testing)
- doors and buttons should reset with loop
- switch should not send signal when already activated
- mutltiple buttons for one door not working
- somehow third loop player reset to begining after one played segment and then cant do shit
- ground cosmetics shouldnt collide
- weird players collisions?
